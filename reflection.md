# Reflection

## Peer feedback

On June 20, 2024, our project group, F3, gathered with another group for a peer feedback session, where we had the opportunity to present our progress from the past two weeks. They provided us with feedback on both our strengths and areas for improvement.

Here is a list of the feedback provided by the other group and our TA that could be improved:
- Remove graphs that do not contribute to the data story.
- Add more detailed descriptions for the graphs and visuals.
- Reorganize some of the graphs (e.g., place some next to each other) and explore ways to combine multiple variables to create more meaningful graphs.

After the feedback session, we divided the tasks so that each team member had specific feedback point to work on.

## Self-reflection

If this project had lasted an additional week or two, the main idea we would
seek to implement would be to create a unified model of salary based on the
factors we analysed. Currently, every factor is analysed independently of the
others. As such, any differences in compensation noted in the graph of one
factor could result from the other three elements. To better understand how much
of the pay gap results from discrimination, it would be best to combine the
influences of every factor (adjusting expected salary not only on age or work
experience but all four aspects simultaneously). This method can also be seen in
many scientific articles (such as Boll & Lagemann, 2018) but is somewhat
time-consuming. As such, we did not use it for this data story, but we would
have liked to do so, given the opportunity.
